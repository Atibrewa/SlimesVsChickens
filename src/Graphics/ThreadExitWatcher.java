/**
 * In order to shield students from getting into thread hot water with Swing’s “multithreaded but
 * not thread safe” model, we make the main() method behave as if it were a single synchronous call
 * on the UI thread. This means:
 *
 * 1. CanvasWindows automatically draw() their contents when the main thread exits, and
 * 2. CanvasWindow even handlers and animations do not start until after the main thread exits.
 *
 * This class queues up those deferred tasks, and runs them on the Swing UI when it detects that
 * main() is done.
